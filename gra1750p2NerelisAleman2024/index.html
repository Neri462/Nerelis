<h4> Instructions </h4>

<ol>
<li>In a microwave-safe bowl, pour in the milk and microwave it in 15-30 second intervals until it's heated to 110°F. Set the bowl aside.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, stir the flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt together.</li>
<li>Add in the butter and slowly stream in the hot milk while stirring, until a slightly sticky dough forms. Once the dough forms, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>While the dough is sitting, in a large skillet with deep sides or a dutch oven, start heating 2-3 inches of oil.</li>
<li>Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar and the cinnamon together in a small bowl and set it aside.</li>
<li>Create a clean working surface and dust it with flour. Divide up the dough into 8 equal portions, and roll each dough portion in the flour so it is lightly coated with flour. Roll it out into a rough ¼-inch thick circle and repeat with the rest of the dough balls. Place the finished rolled-out circles between parchment paper layers until ready to fry them.</li>
<li>Once the oil in the skillet or dutch reaches 350°F, carefully place one Elephant Ear at a time into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until lightly golden brown in color.</li>
<li>Once it's done, carefully remove it from the oil and place the fried dough on a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.</li>
<li>Place it on a wire rack over a sheet tray. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on top of the ear immediately and repeat with the remaining dough ears. Serve and enjoy.
